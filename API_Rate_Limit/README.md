# Spring Boot API Rate Limiting Example
## This project serves as an example of implementing API rate limiting in a Spring Boot application.

## Overview
### API rate limiting is a technique used to control the number of requests an API consumer can make within a specific time frame. It helps prevent abuse, ensures fair usage of resources, and maintains system stability.

## This project demonstrates how to integrate API rate limiting into a Spring Boot application to:

1. Limit the number of requests per client/user.
2. Define time intervals for rate limiting (e.g., requests per minute, hour, etc.).
3. Handle rate-limited requests gracefully with appropriate HTTP responses.

## Implementation
### The implementation includes:
1. Configuration: Define rate limiting rules and configurations.
2. Interceptors/Aspect: Intercept incoming requests and apply rate limiting logic.
3. Exception Handling: Handle rate-limited requests and return appropriate HTTP responses (e.g., 429 Too Many Requests).
