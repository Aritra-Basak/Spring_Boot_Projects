# Spring Boot ChatGPT Integration with OpenAI API
## This project is a Spring Boot application that leverages the OpenAI API to implement a ChatGPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) model. It allows users to interact with the ChatGPT model by sending API requests and receiving responses in real-time.

## Overview
The main objective of this project is to provide a seamless integration of the ChatGPT model into a Spring Boot application, enabling users to engage in conversations with an AI-powered chatbot. By leveraging the OpenAI API, this application offers a scalable and efficient solution for natural language processing tasks.

## Features
### ChatGPT Interaction:

1. Send text inputs to the ChatGPT model via API requests.
2. Receive AI-generated responses from the ChatGPT model in real-time.

### Customizable Settings:
Configure parameters such as model temperature, maximum tokens, and response length.

### Error Handling:
Handle API errors and provide appropriate error messages to users.

## Technologies Used
1. Spring Boot: Provides a robust framework for building enterprise-grade applications with minimal configuration.
2. OpenAI API: Utilized for accessing the ChatGPT model and generating AI responses.
3. HTTP Client: Used to send and receive API requests and responses.
