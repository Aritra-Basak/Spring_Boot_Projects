# Spring Boot with Spring Data MongoDB Integration
## This project demonstrates how to integrate Spring Boot with Spring Data MongoDB to establish a connection with MongoDB using Spring JPA.

## Overview
Spring Data MongoDB is a part of the larger Spring Data project that provides easy integration with MongoDB databases. It simplifies database access by providing a higher-level abstraction and eliminates the need for boilerplate code typically associated with database operations.

## This project showcases how to leverage Spring Boot along with Spring Data MongoDB to:

### Connect to a MongoDB database.
### Perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations using Spring JPA repositories.
### Utilize MongoDB-specific features such as indexing, query methods, and aggregation.

## Key Features
### Spring Boot: Provides a robust framework for building enterprise-grade applications with minimal configuration.
### Spring Data MongoDB: Offers seamless integration with MongoDB, simplifying database access and providing advanced features.
### Spring JPA Repositories: Enables the use of repository interfaces to perform database operations without writing boilerplate code.
